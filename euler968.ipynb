    "# Weighted Polytope Integer Point Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements an advanced algorithm to solve a weighted counting problem within a 5-dimensional polytope. It uses **Digit Dynamic Programming** (Bit-Decomposition) to handle large constraints and high-dimensional summations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "The goal is to calculate a weighted sum over an integer lattice defined by 10 pairwise linear inequalities. Given variables $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, we solve for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = \\sum_{(x_0, \\dots, x_4) \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{4} p_i^{x_i} \\right) \\pmod{10^9+7}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $p_i$ are the first five prime numbers $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\\}$.\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of non-negative integers satisfying $x_i + x_j \\leq \\text{Capacity}_{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Methodology: Digit-by-Digit DP\n",
    "Since the capacities are as large as $10^9$, brute-force iteration is impossible. The algorithm decomposes each variable $x_i$ into its binary representation: $x_i = \\sum \\text{bit}_{i,k} \\cdot 2^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition & Carry Logic\n",
    "The algorithm processes bits from Least Significant (LSB) to Most Significant (MSB). For each bit level $k$:\n",
    "1. We test all 32 combinations (using a `mask`) for the current bits of the 5 variables.\n",
    "2. For each constraint $x_i + x_j \\leq C$, we check if the selected bits exceed the current available capacity.\n",
    "3. We calculate the \"Carry\" for the next bit level to ensure the inequality holds for higher powers of 2:\n",
    "   $$\\text{next\\_cap} = \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{remaining\\_capacity} - (b_i + b_j)}{2} \\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Code Structure & Key Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure clarity during code review, the following variables represent the core mathematical logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`bit_weights[bit_level][i]`**: Precomputed values of $p_i^{2^{bit\\_level}} \\pmod{MOD}$. This allows the multiplicative weight to be calculated incrementally.\n",
    "* **`solve_weighted_polytope`**: The entry point that takes the initial 10 constraints and starts the bitwise recursion.\n",
    "* **`calculate_bit_contribution`**: The recursive engine (Digit DP). It explores valid bit combinations level by level.\n",
    "* **`remaining_capacities`**: A tuple representing the state of the 10 constraints at the current bit level. This is the primary key for **Memoization**.\n",
    "* **`mask`**: An integer (0-31) representing the chosen bits for $x_0 \\dots x_4$ at the current level.\n",
    "* **`future_sum`**: The result of the recursive call for the next bit significance level ($k+1$).\n",
    "* **`current_weight`**: The weight contribution of the chosen bits at the current level: $\\prod p_i^{b_{i,k} \\cdot 2^k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Efficiency\n",
    "- **Memoization:** By storing the results of `(remaining_capacities, bit_level)`, we prune the state space significantly.\n",
    "- **Complexity:** $O(2^5 \\cdot \\log(\\text{Max\\_Cap}) \\cdot \\text{Unique\\_States})$.\n",
    "- **Pruning:** Invalid paths (where bits exceed capacity) are terminated immediately, making the algorithm highly performant for constraints up to $10^9$."
